# Changelog

Notable changes. This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org). While on `0.x`, minor versions may include breaking changes (see Stability below).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.1]

Initial release.

- Federated, layered, cached policy engine (`Policy`, `PolicyModule`, `PolicyRegistry`) with per-verdict explainability (`module` / `layer` / `rule_id` / `reason`).
- Runtime trust-tier enforcement (`min_trust_tier`).
- Fenced LLM judge (`LLMJudge`, `ReferenceJudge`) — clamps to a ceiling, fail-closed.
- Audit sinks: JSONL, webhook/SIEM, fan-out, memory.
- Local-first identity block: attest -> mint scoped token; local + container + remote (E2B) runtimes.
- Integration surfaces: `guard mcp` MCP gateway, `@guarded` decorator, `guard.wrap`.
- Bundled policy modules for shell / git / postgres / filesystem / kubernetes.
- `guard run` governed terminal execution.

## Stability

- Public API is everything exported from `agent_guard` and `identity` top-level packages.
- On `0.x`: breaking changes may land in minor releases, called out here and in the release notes. Pin to `~=0.0` (or an exact version) if you need stability.
- At `1.0`: semver is enforced — breaking changes only in majors, with a deprecation period.
- Ships PEP 561 type information (`py.typed`); downstream type-checkers see inline types.
